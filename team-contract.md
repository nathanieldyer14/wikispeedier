# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

    We plan on meeting weekly on Thursdays at 2pm in Grainger library. We will need no software unless someone cannot attend, in which case Zoom shall be utilized. Each meeting will likely last under an hour. We will take notes together on a shared Google document.
2. **Assistance** 
    We will be able to contact eachother through Snapchat, text, or email and will be expected to respond that same day. We can also meet/talk to each other in person.
3. **Respect** 
    We will actively encourage group members who seem to be communicating less to engage with the rest of the team. In this way, everyone will included and have plenty of opportunities to speak. 
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
    Work will be distributed as necessary based on members' particular abilities and strengths. In the event of a conflict, we will either vote or go with the person with the lower overall workload. For unforeseen work, we will meet to discuss who will do it, or how to split it up among us so that such obstacles are overcome more quickly. 
5. **Time Commitment** 
    As of now we hope to work approximately three hours per week per member. This will be adjusted as necessary if work seems to take longer than anticipated. If new commitments or conflicts arise that prevent groupmembers from putting in their hours that week, we will accomodate and determine the proper course of action for the following week.
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
    If there is a disagreement between members, we will have a group meeting where each party is able to voice their side of the story. We will then, as a group, come to a consensus about who is in the right or if a compromise needs to be reached. In the event that a group meeting or direct contact doesn't fix the issue, we will contact course staff to mitigate the situation.
